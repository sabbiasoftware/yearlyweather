# yearlyweather

A simple web app to check weather history around a specific day of the year. You can check weather stats at your home town on your birthday for fun, or see if weather was gracous on first Saturdays of October on your running race of choice.

The app is NOT intended to be used as a weather forecast tool. It just presentes historical weather data.
